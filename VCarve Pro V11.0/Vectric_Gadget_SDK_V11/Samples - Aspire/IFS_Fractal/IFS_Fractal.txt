The fractals are generated using Iterated Function Systems.

They work by taking an intial point (x,y) and computing the next point in the sequence (x_next, y_next) by applying a transformation of the form

x_next = a * x + b * y + e
y_next = c * x + d * y + f

The point (x_next, y_next) is used to light up the Relief before setting

x = x_next and
y = y_next 

and repeating the process for the desired number of iterations.

The numbers a, b, c, d, e, f together with a probability p define a Function System.

Each of the files in the Fractals directory defines and Iterated Function System.

Each line in each file is of the format

a b c d e f p

Where a, b, c, d, e and f are used in the formulae above and p is the probability that the set of coefficients will be used in any given iteration.

The probabilities within a file should sum to 1.0.
