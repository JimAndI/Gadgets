Summary
This project was inspired by Bob at I Like to Make Stuff. Bob has a YouTube channel where he makes a variety of projects. One project was the automation of a dust collection system using an Arduino to control servos that would open and close blast gates. The servo is mounted to the blast gates using custom brackets. I followed Bob's design to create a 3d printable version of these brackets. The original source for this project can be found here:

The brackets include a left side mount, right side mount, and an actuator arm. These are designed to fit a 4" blast gate. These were designed in Fusion360. F3d and stl files are included.
