Chamfer Radius is a new gadget that enables you to easily create a radiused edge on a closed contour. The gadget adds the capability to make a radius on either an inside contour or an outside contour. I've included a few preview examples for you to browse. I have also included a screen shot of the ball mill tool set up I used to create the examples. While I use it as an alternative for the regular angled chamfer for deburring metal, I think you will find many uses for it in wood working.

--- ATTENTION ---
-- Chamfer Radius is based on Chamfer In & Out
-- Chamfer In & Out - is a modified version of the Vectric Chamfer Gadget v1.1 
-- The various modifications were done by me - Jeff Elliott. If you would like to contact me I can be reached via the Vectric forum.

I have attached the "Chamfer Radius" for your use. Works great for me, but your mileage may vary. Use caution until you have tested it in your environment. 

To install the "Chamfer Radius", unzip then place a copy of the Chamfer Radius folder in the standard gadget location on your computer. On my computer it would be placed in the following directory:

C:\Users\Public\Documents\Vectric Files\Gadgets\Aspire V4.5

After placing it in the correct directory, restart your Vectric software and you will see the new "Chamfer Radius" entry in the gadget drop down menu.
